# Fort-Peck-Flows

## Description
This repository defines a pallid sturgeon demographic population model.  This model is:

- age-specific, 
- a (Leslie) matrix model, and
- deterministic with a stochastic version for handling environmental variability.

It is parameterized for the population of pallid sturgeon residing in the Upper Missouri River from below Fort Peck to the headwaters of Lake Sakakawea, including the Yellowstone River from below Intake Dam down to its confluence with the Missouri River.

The model allows for input values of retention probability and spawning proportion in order to analyze differences in alternative Fort Peck management flows and is fully described in the model documentation submitted to the USACE.[^1]

## Objectives
This model was designed to: 

1. Evaluate the long-term population growth rate of pallid sturgeon given particular climatic/environmental conditions and alternative management flows. 

2. Evaluate population expected time to quasiextinction under environmental variability.

3. Evaluate the sensitivity of long-term population growth rates and expected time to quasiextinction to parameter values.

4.  Explore long-term population growth-decline boundaries in terms of retention probability, spawning proportion, and age-0 survival given retention. 

5.  Inform management decisions at Fort Peck.
