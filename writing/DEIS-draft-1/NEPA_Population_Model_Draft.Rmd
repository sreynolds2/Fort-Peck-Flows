\caption{Long-term growth rates by alternative Fort Peck flow scenario and year given median historical water temperature conditions.  Years from the period of record (1930-2012) in which at least one alternative hydrograph could be produced with spawning cue discharges greater than 20kcfs were analyzed in HEC-RAS.  Spawning cues surpassing the 20kcfs magnitude were assumed to result in 50\% of reproductively-ready females spawning in the Missouri River (vs. spawning in the Yellowstone River or not spawning).  Retention probabilities were computed from the HEC-RAS simulations and used to compute $\lambda$ values, i.e., the long-term growth rate.  If a long-term growth rate value is absent for a particular year and flow scenario combination, it is because either the hydrograph could not be produce given the environmental conditions of that year or the spawning cue threshold discharge of 20kcfs was not surpassed (and therefore HEC-RAS simulations were not run to calculate a retention probability).   NA's indicate year and scenario combinations for which HEC-RAS outputs are pending.}

\caption{Population growth-decline boundaries ($\lambda=1$) when retention probability is A) 20\% and B) 70\%.  All dots indicate a population whose reproductively-ready females spawn in the Missouri River 50\% of the time, i.e., $\gamma=0.5$.  Red dots indicate a population where 75 out of every 1,000,000 eggs are expected to survive to age-1 given retention in the free-flowing Missouri River ($\phi_0=0.000075$), and blue dots indicate a population where 25 out of every 10,000 eggs are expected to survive to age-1 given retention ($\phi_0=0.0025$).  Red dots are in a region of decline (below and left of the curve), while blue dots are in a region of growth (above and to the right of the curve).  The dashed line indicates Pine et al.'s (2001) upper estimate of age-0 survival for gulf sturgeon, 0.0004.  Population growth at this survival level can occur but only at high spawning and retention probabilities.}

\caption{Long-term growth rate ($\lambda$) values for six Fort Peck flow scenarios under particular historical temperature and powerhouse operation combinations: LF--low water temperature, full powerhouse operations; L--low water temperature, standard powerhouse operations; LP--low water temperature, peak time powerhouse operations, and similar for M--median water temperature and H--high water temperature.  \textit{Check:  Median water temperatures were taken over the historical period of record (years), while low and high water temperatures were estimated as the lower and upper 95\% confidence intervals.} Full powerhouse operations assume 14kcfs are run through the powerhouse 24 hours a day; standard powerhouse operations assume 14kcfs are run through the powerhouse for 12 hours a day with 7kcfs running through the powerhouse the remaining 12 hours; peak time powerhouse operations assume 7kcfs are run through the powerhouse except during peak times (\textit{times here}) when 14kcfs are run through.}

\caption{Growth decline boundaries by alternative management scenario.  Each contour line has a fixed retention probability that was computed form HEC-RAS outputs and represents a particular year in which the given alternative scenario met the flow criteria.   For a given year/retention probability, a population is expected to grow if spawning and age-0 survival probabilities fall in the space above and to the right of the curve, or, decline if spawning and age-0 survival probabilities fall in the space below and to the left of the curve. Spawning probability ($\gamma$) is the probability that a reproductively-ready female spawns in the Missouri River (vs. spawning in the Yellowstone or not spawning and reabsorbing her eggs).  Age-0 survival ($\phi_0$) is the probability of surviving from egg to age-1 given retention in the free-flowing Missouri River.}
